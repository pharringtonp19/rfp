## **Overview**
We provide two sets of notebooks in this folder. 

### **Motivation Folder**
As the name suggests, notebooks in [motivation](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/rfp/tree/main/notebooks-scripts/motivation) highlight the following:
- How standard smoothing methods fail to account for the local presence of clusters
- How the fundamental challenge of learning in high dimensions isn't affected by the presence of clusters
- The importance of regularization

### **Training Folder**
In the [training](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/rfp/tree/main/notebooks-scripts/training%20) folder we provide training notebooks for fitting neural
networks via [gradient descent](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/rfp/blob/main/notebooks-scripts/training%20/standard_training.ipynb) and [regularized bi-level gradient descent](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/rfp/blob/main/notebooks-scripts/training%20/rfp_training.ipynb)
