### **Overview**

??? question "Is this the right population?"

    - "[It](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/rapid-re-housing-a-history-and-core-components/) is imperative that any lease agreement provides the tenant with **the same rights and responsibilities as a typical lease holder** and that the financial terms of the lease are such that the household has a reasonable ability to assume rental costs once financial support ends (keeping in mind that in the majority of cases, even households with no income at move-in retain their housing)"
    - "[The](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99153/rapid_re-housings_role_in_responding_to_homelessness_3.pdf) target populations for these programs were households who faced barriers to housing, but who were not likely to need long-term assistance"

    - "[Rapid](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99153/rapid_re-housings_role_in_responding_to_homelessness_3.pdf) re-housing is intended to serve people experiencing homelessness with no preconditions such as employment, income, absence of criminal record, or sobriety

### Questions
- According to his research, legal
services attorneys tended not to represent tenants in evictions brought by large,
corporate landlords; instead, they primarily defended tenants in evictions
brought by private individual landlords, including a substantial percentage of
"mom and pop" landlords who lived in the same buildings as their tenants. 
- However, as will be seen below, very few
tenants represented by legal services attorneys file answers; more often, their
cases are settled, dismissed, or withdrawn during the pretrial phases of
litigation. Accordingly, in cases involving legal services attorneys, the housing
court files contain little information on tenant defenses.
### **Related Literature**
- Previous studies have compared evictions involving tenants represented by legal services attorneys and evictions involving unrepresented tenants --[reference](https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/16794/15_13YaleL_PolyRev385_1995_.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)
- took thirty percent longer to reach final disposition than cases in which tenants represented themselves and
contested their evictions.

#### Differentiating Outcomes
-  landlords withdrew their
actions
- terms of settlement agreements

#### Terms
- capitalization rate 
- negative leverage
- judgment of possession
- arrears
- VI score (vulnerability)
