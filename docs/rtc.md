### Questions
- According to his research, legal
services attorneys tended not to represent tenants in evictions brought by large,
corporate landlords; instead, they primarily defended tenants in evictions
brought by private individual landlords, including a substantial percentage of
"mom and pop" landlords who lived in the same buildings as their tenants. 
- However, as will be seen below, very few
tenants represented by legal services attorneys file answers; more often, their
cases are settled, dismissed, or withdrawn during the pretrial phases of
litigation. Accordingly, in cases involving legal services attorneys, the housing
court files contain little information on tenant defenses.
### **Related Literature**
- Previous studies have compared evictions involving tenants represented by legal services attorneys and evictions involving unrepresented tenants --[reference](https://openyls.law.yale.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13051/16794/15_13YaleL_PolyRev385_1995_.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)
- took thirty percent longer to reach final disposition than cases in which tenants represented themselves and
contested their evictions.
